# Hello World! 

My name is Giuseppe Baldini.

I set up this website as a way to experiment with HTML / CSS and GitHub Pages.  
As you can see, it's nothing fancy now: a picture, text and links. 

## Notes

A quick overview on some elements:

**Font**: [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) <> Fallbacks: Verdana, Helvetica

**Size**: Body (14px) - Name (34px)

**Colors**: Links = Light Blue (1772d0) <> Hover = Bright Green (00cc88) 

## What's next

Here are a few thoughts / ideas for future me:

1. Try out **Jekyll Themes**  - [Prologue](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jekyll-theme-prologue/), [Space](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/space-jekyll-template/) and [Cayman](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/cayman-theme/) look good
2. Play around with **fonts** - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a great place to start!
3. Improve **mobile responsiveness** - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) may be of help
